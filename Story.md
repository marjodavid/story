 Once upon a time, in a software company there was a lonely programmer.
His name is Bienvenido and he likes drinking coffee.
 
 One day, He encountered a problem while managing his code's version control and 
Bien lost his mind and decide to do drugs. But before things get worse, a Hero named Jays appeared behind Bien's loneliness. Jays introduced him to GIT.

Lo and behold, they went to their ever reliable buddy, EJ, to go on a conquest to conquer Git.
